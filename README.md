In This project, I made a to-do-list(Task-manager) by python.
The features: 1) add a tasks
              2) see the tasks you add
              3) mark the completed tasks 
              4) you can see if the task end ✔ or not ❌
              5) quit
it based on making functions for each task(add, mark, view)
